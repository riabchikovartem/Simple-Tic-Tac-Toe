The project is made by Artem Riabchikov & OpenAI based on hyperskill.org project "Simple-Tic-Tac-Toe" using Kotlin.
To make this project, I used open github project of github user marckoch.
Description from hyperskill: 
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
